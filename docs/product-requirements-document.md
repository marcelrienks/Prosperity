## Executive Summary

**Prosperity** is a **personal portfolio tracker and overview tool** designed to replace an Excel-based investment tracking system. This is a personal-use application, not intended for professional or regulated financial management. The primary purpose is to provide a simple, flexible interface for tracking stock investments across multiple accounts with real-time price updates and basic performance analytics.

**Application Type:**
- **Personal Use:** Not designed for professional financial management or regulatory compliance
- **Portfolio Tracker:** Overview and tracking tool, not a full portfolio manager
- **Simplified Auditing:** Only deposits and transfers require audit history (for total invested and annualized return calculations)

**Key Objectives:**
- Eliminate manual Excel data entry and formula maintenance
- Provide real-time stock price updates via Google Finance API
- Support multiple investment accounts (TFSA, US, ZA, EUR, Property)
- Support multi-user access with role-based permissions (Admin, Owner, Viewer)
- Calculate profit/loss, returns, and portfolio performance automatically
- Track minimal required data (quantity and invested amount) with optional details (fees, costs)
- Maintain audit trail for deposits and transfers only (for total invested tracking)
- Enable manual tracking of dividends, interest, and profits via direct balance adjustments
- Enable efficient portfolio management on both desktop and mobile devices
- Serve as a learning exercise for modern web technologies (Blazor WASM, Go, Azure, AWS)

**Technology Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Blazor WebAssembly hosted on AWS S3 + CloudFront
- **Backend:** Azure Functions (Go runtime)
- **Database:** Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL)
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **External APIs:** Google Finance API for stock prices and currency conversion

### Application Scope
- **Portfolio Tracker:** Overview and tracking, not full portfolio management
- **Personal Use:** Not intended for professional or regulated financial use
