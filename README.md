# Prosperity: Personal Stock Portfolio Manager

**Prosperity** is a web-based application designed to help users track and manage their personal investment portfolios across multiple accounts and asset types. The application combines a modern .NET front end with scalable AWS Lambda (.NET Core) services and a cloud-native backend, all orchestrated via AWS CloudFormation and secured under a custom subdomain using AWS Route 53. This document describes the high-level functionality, technology stack, and a phased plan to deliver a robust portfolio management solution.

## Core Features

- **Multi-Account Support**: Organize your investments by region, stock exchange, account type (e.g., TFSA), or even unique categories like property shares.
- **Account Pages**: Each account has a dedicated page showing detailed information for all holdings.
- **Portfolio Overview**: Aggregate view of all accounts, displaying total deposited, invested, current value, and profits.
- **Stock Tracking**: 
  - Ticker symbol
  - Short company description
  - Current stock price (fetched live via Google Finance API)
  - Purchase details (amount, price, date) stored in a local database
  - Real-time calculation of current value and profit/loss
- **Authentication**: Secure login required for all site access.
- **Cloud Native Deployment**: Infrastructure as code (CloudFormation), public subdomain under prosperity, and DNS management with AWS Route 53.

## Project Plan

### 1. Competitive Analysis (âœ… Completed)
See `docs/competitive-analysis.md`
A thorough review of leading portfolio management apps was conducted. Key features, pain points, and MVP recommendations were documented to inform Prosperityâ€™s direction.

### 2. Stakeholder Requirements (âœ… Completed)
See `docs/stakeholder-requirements.md`
A detailed requirements document was created based on current workflows and future needs, covering accounts, data points, reporting, and user stories.

### 3. Architecture Design (âœ… Completed)
See `docs/architecture-design.md`
A comprehensive architecture was designed, including technology stack, system components, data flow, security, and cost analysis. The solution leverages a Blazor WASM frontend (AWS S3/CloudFront) and a Go-based Azure Functions backend.

### 4. Full Project Roadmap (ðŸš§ Incomplete)
Define implementation phases, break down MVP and future features, and set milestones for each stage of the project.

### 5. Core Development (ðŸš§ Incomplete)
Set up infrastructure, implement authentication, develop core pages, integrate live pricing, and build backend logic and data layers.

### 6. Testing & QA (ðŸš§ Incomplete)
Develop and run unit/integration tests, perform manual QA, and conduct security and performance testing.

### 7. Deployment (ðŸš§ Incomplete)
Configure DNS, deploy to production, enable HTTPS, and set up monitoring/logging.

### 8. Iteration & Feature Expansion (ðŸš§ Incomplete)
Add advanced features, improve UX, and iterate based on user feedback.

**Objective:** Design a scalable, maintainable, and secure system architecture.

**Components:**
- **Frontend:** ASP.NET web application (Razor Pages or Blazor), responsive design.
- **Backend Service Layer:** AWS Lambda (.NET Core) for business logic and integration (pricing, account management).
- **Database:** AWS RDS (SQL or NoSQL depending on requirements) for portfolio, account, and transaction data.
- **Authentication:** AWS Cognito or custom .NET Identity (integrated with Lambda and frontend).
- **Pricing API Integration:** Google Finance (scraping or third-party API), with caching for rate limiting.
- **Infrastructure:** AWS CloudFormation templates for automated resource provisioning.
- **Domain & DNS:** AWS Route 53 for subdomain management under prosperity.
- **Security:** HTTPS everywhere, IAM roles for Lambda, encrypted data at rest and in transit.

### 4. Full Project Roadmap

**Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements**
- Conduct detailed competitor analysis.
- Complete stakeholder questionnaire and finalize PRD.
- Define MVP scope.

**Phase 2: Architecture & Design**
- Finalize architecture diagrams and technology selections.
- Design database schema and API contracts.
- Create wireframes and UI prototypes.

**Phase 3: Core Development**
- Set up CloudFormation scripts for base infrastructure.
- Implement authentication and account management flows.
- Develop the portfolio and account pages.
- Integrate live stock pricing.
- Create backend Lambda functions for business logic.
- Set up DB schema and data access layers.

**Phase 4: Testing & QA**
- Unit and integration tests for all modules.
- Manual QA of UI/UX flows.
- Security and performance testing.

**Phase 5: Deployment**
- Configure Route 53 and deploy to public subdomain.
- Enable HTTPS and security best practices.
- Set up monitoring and logging.

**Phase 6: Iteration & Feature Expansion**
- Add advanced features (alerts, reporting, imports/exports, mobile/responsive enhancements).
- Gather user feedback for continuous improvement.
