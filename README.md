## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Prosperity uses a **hybrid cloud architecture** combining AWS for static hosting and Azure for serverless backend:

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Browser   │ (Blazor WebAssembly)
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ├─────────→ AWS S3 + CloudFront (Static Assets)
       │
       └─────────→ Azure Functions (Go) ─→ Cosmos DB
                   ├─→ Google Finance API
                   └─→ ExchangeRate-API
```
