# Issue #004: Full Project Roadmap

**Status:** 📋 TO DO  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 hours  
**Created:** October 14, 2025  

## Objective
Create a detailed project roadmap with specific phases, milestones, and deliverables for the complete Prosperity application development.

## Description
Develop a comprehensive project plan that breaks down the development process into manageable phases with clear deliverables, timelines, and dependencies based on the architecture and requirements defined in previous steps.

## Action Items
- [ ] Define detailed phases with specific deliverables:
  - [ ] **Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements** (completed foundation work)
  - [ ] **Phase 2: Architecture & Design** (detailed technical design)
  - [ ] **Phase 3: Core Development** (MVP implementation)
  - [ ] **Phase 4: Testing & QA** (quality assurance)
  - [ ] **Phase 5: Deployment** (production setup)
  - [ ] **Phase 6: Iteration & Feature Expansion** (post-MVP enhancements)

- [ ] Create detailed work breakdown structure:
  - [ ] Break each phase into specific tasks
  - [ ] Estimate effort and duration for each task
  - [ ] Identify task dependencies
  - [ ] Define acceptance criteria for each deliverable

- [ ] Establish project timeline:
  - [ ] Set realistic milestones and deadlines
  - [ ] Account for personal development time constraints
  - [ ] Build in buffer time for learning and problem-solving

## Deliverables
- [ ] Detailed project roadmap document (`docs/project-roadmap.md`)
- [ ] Phase-by-phase work breakdown structure
- [ ] Project timeline with milestones
- [ ] Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- [ ] Resource requirements and constraints documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All six phases clearly defined with specific objectives
- [ ] Each phase broken down into actionable tasks
- [ ] Dependencies between phases and tasks identified
- [ ] Realistic timeline established for personal development pace
- [ ] MVP scope clearly differentiated from future enhancements
- [ ] Risk factors identified with mitigation strategies
- [ ] Success criteria defined for each phase

## Dependencies
- Requires completion of Issue #002: Stakeholder Questionnaire
- Requires completion of Issue #003: Architecture Brainstorm
- Informed by Issue #001: Competitive Analysis

- Authentication implementation
- Core portfolio management features
- Basic reporting and analytics
- Stock pricing integration

### Phase 4: Testing & QA
- Unit testing implementation
- Integration testing
- Manual QA processes
- Performance testing
- Security testing

### Phase 5: Deployment
- Production environment setup

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Define measurable success criteria for each phase
- [ ] Establish quality gates for phase completion
- [ ] Create feedback loops for continuous improvement

## Next Steps
After completion, begin execution starting with the detailed work items from Phase 2.
