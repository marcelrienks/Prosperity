# Issue #003: Architecture Brainstorm

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ TO DO  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours  
**Created:** October 14, 2025  

## Objective
Design a scalable, maintainable, and secure system architecture for the personal portfolio management application.

## Description
Based on requirements gathered from the stakeholder questionnaire, design the technical architecture including technology stack decisions, system components, data flow, and infrastructure approach.

## Action Items
- [ ] Finalize technology stack decisions:
  - [ ] Frontend framework (ASP.NET Razor Pages vs Blazor)
  - [ ] Backend service approach (AWS Lambda vs traditional web API)
  - [ ] Database selection (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or SQLite for simplicity)
  - [ ] Authentication method (AWS Cognito vs ASP.NET Identity)
  - [ ] Hosting approach (AWS vs Azure vs local hosting)

- [ ] Design system components:
  - [ ] Frontend architecture and page structure
  - [ ] Backend API design and endpoints
  - [ ] Database schema design
  - [ ] Authentication and authorization flow
  - [ ] External API integration approach (stock pricing)
  - [ ] Caching strategy for performance

- [ ] Create architecture documentation:
  - [ ] System architecture diagram
  - [ ] Database entity relationship diagram
  - [ ] API contract specifications
  - [ ] Data flow diagrams
  - [ ] Security architecture overview

## Deliverables
- [ ] Architecture design document (`docs/architecture-design.md`)
- [ ] System architecture diagrams
- [ ] Database schema design
- [ ] API endpoint specifications
- [ ] Technology stack justification document
- [ ] Security and privacy design considerations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All major system components identified and documented
- [ ] Technology stack decisions made with clear rationale
- [ ] Database schema supports all identified requirements
- [ ] API design supports frontend needs and future extensibility
- [ ] Security considerations addressed throughout architecture
- [ ] Performance and scalability considerations documented
- [ ] Integration points with external services clearly defined

## Dependencies
- Requires completion of Issue #002: Stakeholder Questionnaire
- Informed by Issue #001: Competitive Analysis findings

## Key Architecture Considerations
- **Simplicity vs Scalability:** Balance between personal use simplicity and potential future expansion
- **Cost Optimization:** Consider hosting costs for personal application
- **Data Privacy:** Ensure no sensitive financial data leaves personal control
- **Offline Capability:** Consider local-first approach with cloud backup
- **Manual Entry Focus:** Architecture should prioritize manual data entry over automated syncing

## Technical Decisions to Make
- Cloud vs self-hosted deployment
- Monolithic vs microservices approach
- Real-time vs batch pricing updates
- Client-side vs server-side rendering
- Database normalization level
- Backup and disaster recovery approach

## Next Steps
After completion, proceed to Issue #004: Full Project Roadmap with detailed implementation phases.
