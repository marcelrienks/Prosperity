# Issue #003: Architecture Brainstorm

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours  
**Created:** October 14, 2025  
**Completed:** October 15, 2025  

## Objective
Design a scalable, maintainable, and secure system architecture for the personal portfolio management application.

## Description
Based on requirements gathered from the stakeholder questionnaire, design the technical architecture including technology stack decisions, system components, data flow, and infrastructure approach.

## Action Items
- [x] Finalize technology stack decisions:
  - [x] Frontend framework (Blazor WebAssembly)
  - [x] Backend service approach (Azure Functions with Go)
  - [x] Database selection (Azure Cosmos DB - NoSQL)
  - [x] Authentication method (JWT-based authentication)
  - [x] Hosting approach (Hybrid: AWS for frontend, Azure for backend)

- [x] Design system components:
  - [x] Frontend architecture and page structure
  - [x] Backend API design and endpoints
  - [x] Database schema design
  - [x] Authentication and authorization flow
  - [x] External API integration approach (stock pricing)
  - [x] Caching strategy for performance

- [x] Create architecture documentation:
  - [x] System architecture diagram
  - [x] Database entity relationship diagram
  - [x] API contract specifications
  - [x] Data flow diagrams
  - [x] Security architecture overview

## Deliverables
- [x] Architecture design document (`docs/architecture-design.md`)
- [x] System architecture diagrams
- [x] Database schema design
- [x] API endpoint specifications
- [x] Technology stack justification document
- [x] Security and privacy design considerations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All major system components identified and documented
- [x] Technology stack decisions made with clear rationale
- [x] Database schema supports all identified requirements
- [x] API design supports frontend needs and future extensibility
- [x] Security considerations addressed throughout architecture
- [x] Performance and scalability considerations documented
- [x] Integration points with external services clearly defined

## Dependencies
- Requires completion of Issue #002: Stakeholder Questionnaire
- Informed by Issue #001: Competitive Analysis findings

## Key Architecture Considerations
- **Simplicity vs Scalability:** Balance between personal use simplicity and potential future expansion
- **Cost Optimization:** Consider hosting costs for personal application
- **Data Privacy:** Ensure no sensitive financial data leaves personal control
- **Offline Capability:** Consider local-first approach with cloud backup
- **Manual Entry Focus:** Architecture should prioritize manual data entry over automated syncing

## Technical Decisions to Make
- Cloud vs self-hosted deployment
- Monolithic vs microservices approach
- Real-time vs batch pricing updates
- Client-side vs server-side rendering
- Database normalization level
- Backup and disaster recovery approach

## Next Steps
After completion, proceed to Issue #004: Full Project Roadmap with detailed implementation phases.

## Completion Summary

**Completed:** October 15, 2025

### Architecture Decisions Made

**Frontend Stack:**
- Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) on .NET 8.0+
- MudBlazor or Radzen for UI components
- Fluxor for state management
- Hosted on AWS S3 + CloudFront

**Backend Stack:**
- Azure Functions with Go 1.21+
- Consumption Plan (serverless)
- RESTful API design
- JWT-based authentication

**Database:**
- Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL, SQL API)
- Serverless tier for cost optimization
- Partition key: `userId`

**Infrastructure:**
- Hybrid cloud: AWS (frontend) + Azure (backend)
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- Secrets in Azure Key Vault

**External Services:**
- Alpha Vantage for stock prices
- ExchangeRate-API for currency conversion

### Key Architectural Highlights

1. **Hybrid Cloud Strategy:** Leverages existing AWS infrastructure while gaining Azure experience
2. **Serverless-First:** Estimated monthly cost of ~$0.90 USD (vs $6+ for traditional hosting)
3. **Learning Goals:** Exposure to Blazor, Go, Azure, and NoSQL
4. **Cost-Optimized:** Free tiers and serverless pricing minimize expenses
5. **Scalable:** Architecture supports future multi-user expansion without changes

### Documentation Delivered

- Comprehensive architecture design document (82 KB)
- System architecture diagrams (ASCII art)
- Database schema with 5 collections
- 25+ REST API endpoints documented
- Security architecture and authentication flow
- CI/CD pipeline configurations
- Cost analysis and risk mitigation strategies

### Next Actions

Ready to proceed to Issue #004: Full Project Roadmap to break down implementation into detailed phases and milestones.
