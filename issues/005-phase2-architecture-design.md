# Issue #005: Phase 2 - Architecture & Design Implementation

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ TO DO  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 12-15 hours  
**Created:** October 14, 2025  

## Objective
Implement the detailed architecture and design phase including technical specifications, database design, and UI prototypes.

## Description
Execute Phase 2 of the project roadmap by creating detailed technical specifications, database schemas, API contracts, and UI/UX prototypes based on the architecture decisions from Issue #003.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Finalize Architecture Diagrams and Technology Selections:**
  - [ ] Create detailed system architecture diagram
  - [ ] Document final technology stack decisions
  - [ ] Design deployment architecture
  - [ ] Define security architecture

- [ ] **Design Database Schema and API Contracts:**
  - [ ] Create complete database entity-relationship diagram
  - [ ] Design normalized database schema
  - [ ] Define API endpoints and contracts
  - [ ] Create data access layer specifications

- [ ] **Create Wireframes and UI Prototypes:**
  - [ ] Design main dashboard wireframe
  - [ ] Create account management page mockups
  - [ ] Design portfolio entry/editing interfaces
  - [ ] Create responsive design specifications
  - [ ] Design authentication flow interfaces

## Deliverables
- [ ] Updated architecture design document with final decisions
- [ ] Complete database schema with migration scripts
- [ ] API specification document (OpenAPI/Swagger format)
- [ ] UI wireframes and mockups
- [ ] Technical specification document
- [ ] Data flow and sequence diagrams

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All architecture decisions finalized and documented
- [ ] Database schema supports all identified requirements
- [ ] API contracts defined for all necessary endpoints
- [ ] UI wireframes cover all major user workflows
- [ ] Technical specifications provide clear implementation guidance
- [ ] Security considerations integrated throughout design
- [ ] Performance requirements addressed in design

## Dependencies
- Requires completion of Issue #003: Architecture Brainstorm
- Requires completion of Issue #002: Stakeholder Questionnaire
- Should align with Issue #004: Full Project Roadmap
