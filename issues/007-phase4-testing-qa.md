# Issue #007: Phase 4 - Testing & QA

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ TO DO  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 8-10 hours  
**Created:** October 14, 2025  

## Objective
Implement comprehensive testing and quality assurance for the Prosperity MVP application.

## Description
Execute Phase 4 of the project roadmap by implementing automated testing, conducting manual QA, and performing security and performance testing to ensure the application meets quality standards.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Unit and integration tests for all modules:**
  - [ ] Create unit tests for business logic services
  - [ ] Implement integration tests for API endpoints
  - [ ] Test database operations and data access layer
  - [ ] Create tests for stock pricing integration
  - [ ] Test authentication and authorization flows
  - [ ] Implement portfolio calculation test scenarios

- [ ] **Manual QA of UI/UX flows:**
  - [ ] Test complete user registration and login flow
  - [ ] Verify account creation and management functionality
  - [ ] Test stock entry and portfolio management workflows
  - [ ] Validate dashboard and reporting accuracy
  - [ ] Test responsive design on different devices
  - [ ] Verify error handling and user feedback

- [ ] **Security and performance testing:**
  - [ ] Perform security vulnerability assessment
  - [ ] Test authentication and authorization security
  - [ ] Validate input sanitization and SQL injection protection
  - [ ] Test API rate limiting and error scenarios
  - [ ] Performance test stock price update processes
  - [ ] Load test critical application endpoints

## Deliverables
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite with good code coverage
- [ ] Manual QA test plans and execution results
- [ ] Security assessment report
- [ ] Performance testing results and recommendations
- [ ] Bug tracking and resolution documentation
- [ ] Quality assurance sign-off documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit test coverage of at least 80% for business logic
- [ ] All integration tests pass consistently
- [ ] Manual QA test cases cover all major user workflows
- [ ] No critical security vulnerabilities identified
- [ ] Application performance meets defined benchmarks
- [ ] All identified bugs are documented and resolved
- [ ] Error handling provides appropriate user feedback
- [ ] Responsive design works across target devices
