# Issue #008: Phase 5 - Deployment

**Status:** ðŸ“‹ TO DO  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 6-8 hours  
**Created:** October 14, 2025  

## Objective
Deploy the Prosperity application to production environment with proper security, monitoring, and operational procedures.

## Description
Execute Phase 5 of the project roadmap by setting up production deployment infrastructure, configuring security measures, and establishing monitoring and operational procedures.

## Action Items
- [ ] **Configure Route 53 and deploy to public subdomain:**
  - [ ] Set up custom domain and subdomain configuration
  - [ ] Configure DNS routing and domain verification
  - [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificate management
  - [ ] Configure domain redirects and canonical URLs

- [ ] **Enable HTTPS and security best practices:**
  - [ ] Implement SSL/TLS encryption for all endpoints
  - [ ] Configure security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
  - [ ] Set up Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules
  - [ ] Implement API rate limiting and DDoS protection
  - [ ] Configure secure cookie and session management

- [ ] **Set up monitoring and logging:**
  - [ ] Implement application performance monitoring
  - [ ] Set up error tracking and alerting
  - [ ] Configure log aggregation and analysis
  - [ ] Create health check endpoints and monitoring
  - [ ] Set up automated backup procedures
  - [ ] Configure uptime monitoring and notifications

## Deliverables
- [ ] Production-ready deployed application
- [ ] Custom domain with SSL/TLS configuration
- [ ] Security hardening implementation
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting system
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Deployment documentation and runbooks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application is accessible via custom subdomain with HTTPS
- [ ] All security best practices are implemented
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting systems are operational
- [ ] Automated backups are configured and tested
- [ ] Performance monitoring provides actionable insights
- [ ] Error tracking captures and reports issues appropriately
- [ ] Deployment process is documented and repeatable
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures are tested and documented

## Dependencies
- Requires completion of Issue #007: Phase 4 - Testing & QA
- Application must pass all quality assurance checks
- Production infrastructure must be provisioned

## Deployment Areas

### Infrastructure Setup
